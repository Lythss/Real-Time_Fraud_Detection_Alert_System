# Real-Time Fraud Detection & Alert System ðŸš¨

Welcome to the **Real-Time Fraud Detection & Alert System** repository! This project is designed to detect suspicious financial activities in near real-time while minimizing false alerts. It provides a robust, scalable solution by integrating multiple data sources, leveraging Hive for data storage, and orchestrating the workflow with Apache Airflow.

## Features âœ¨
- **API Endpoints**:  
  - `/api/transactions`: Access detailed transaction data (ID, timestamp, amount, currency, merchant details, customer ID, transaction type).  
  - `/api/customers`: Retrieve customer data including account history, demographics, and behavior patterns.  
  - `/api/externalData`: Fetch external data such as blacklist info, credit scores, and fraud reports.
- **Data Integration**: Seamless collection and cleaning of transactional, customer, and external data.
- **Hive Storage**: Efficient data storage with partitioning and bucketing strategies.
- **Rule-Based Fraud Detection**: Use of HiveQL queries to flag high-risk transactions based on set rules.
- **Orchestration with Airflow**: Automated workflows for data ingestion, processing, and real-time alerting.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Automated deployments using GitHub Actions.
